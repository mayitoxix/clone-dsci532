- Added optional point marker layer for individual crime incidents to allow granular spatial inspection (up to 2000 points). (User Story #1) [#61](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_7_vancouver-neighbourhood-safety/pull/61)
- Implemented choropleth layer displaying crime rate per 1,000 residents by neighbourhood to enable normalized comparison across differently sized areas. (User Story #3) [#61](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_7_vancouver-neighbourhood-safety/pull/61)

### Changed


### Fixed


### Known Issues
- The map section is rendering in a default wide view, and is not using the entire available space. Trobleshooting is active to solve for this situation.

### Reflection
- We had a full connection across our input and outputs, so creating a sub frame (PLOTS and KPIs) in our reactivity diagram provided clarity and refinement to our diagram.
